#Contains the documents to be discussed in the 1st Reproducible Research workshop to be held in Kastanienbaum, Switzerland, February 7 2018

The goals of this "hands on workshop" are 
1. Interact among us to understand better the reproducible research ecosystem to anticipate the incipient regulation from public funding agencies towards attaching a-priori or a-posteriori reproducible research doc together with the main proposal/report,
2. Fussioning data and codes in a unique doc and attach them to data- and code-bases when submitting papers to journals, and 
3. Facilitate the public, other scientists, skateholders, practicioners, etc, the reproducibility of our research and the implementation of science-based  biodiversity management.
