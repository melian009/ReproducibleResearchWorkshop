The goals of this "hands on workshop" are 
1. Interact among us to understand better the reproducible research ecosystem to anticipate the incipient regulation from public funding agencies towards attaching a-priori or a-posteriori reproducible research doc together with the main proposal/report,
2. Fussioning data and codes in a unique doc and attach them to data- and code-bases when submitting papers to journals, and 
3. Facilitate the public, other scientists, skateholders, practicioners, etc, the reproducibility of our research and the implementation of science-based  biodiversity management.
